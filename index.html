                    rachel was content studying pharmacy, though she maintained a certain 
                    curiosity towards passionate people. time flew by, when she chanced upon a youtube video by polymatter,
                    "not everyone should code." after spending a couple of hours in python, hiss, she enrolled to study computer 
                    science and has not looked back.

                    <br>
                    though enjoyable and rewarding, building this website has indeed made me more curious about backend.
